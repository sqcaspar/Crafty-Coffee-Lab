# SCA Cupping Protocol Scoring System

## Main Takeaway

The SCA Cupping Protocol scores coffee on a 100-point scale, based on ten sensory and uniformity/cleanliness attributes. Each attribute is scored individually, then summed and adjusted for defects.

## 1. Attributes and Scoring Range

Under the 2004 SCA Cupping Protocol, a single assessor evaluates one coffee sample across these components:

| Category | Maximum Points | Measurement Method |
|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| Fragrance/Aroma | 10 | Orthonasal smell of grounds (fragrance) and brewed coffee (aroma) |
| Flavor | 10 | Combined retronasal aroma + taste while sipping |
| Aftertaste | 10 | Persistence and quality of flavor after swallowing |
| Acidity | 10 | Perceived brightness or liveliness (not sourness) |
| Body | 10 | Mouthfeel weight and viscosity |
| Balance | 10 | Harmony between acidity, sweetness, body, and flavor |
| Sweetness | 10 | Gustatory or retronasal perception of sweetness |
| Clean Cup | 10 | Absence of negative floating or suspended particles, odors |
| Uniformity | 10 | Consistency of key attributes across five individually brewed cups |
| Overall | 10 | General impression, including additional desirable characteristics |

Each attribute is scored on a scale of 6.00–10.00 (integer or half-point increments), where 6.00 indicates "meets minimum quality" and 10.00 indicates "extraordinary quality."

## 2. Defect Penalties

Defects are classified as either taints or faults.

- **Taint** (e.g., papery, medicinal): –2 points per cup
- **Fault** (e.g., moldy, phenolic, sour/phenolic): –4 points per cup

For each defective cup, subtract the corresponding penalty. Defect penalties apply after summing the attribute scores.

## 3. Scoring Formula

Let:
- F₁…F₁₀ be the ten individual attribute scores (each 6.00–10.00)
- T = number of tainted cups × 2
- D = number of faulty cups × 4

Then the **Final Score** is:

```
Final Score = Σ(i=1 to 10) Fi - (2 × Tainted cups) - (4 × Faulty cups)
```

The result is rounded to two decimal places (typical practice is to the nearest 0.25).

## 4. Example Calculation

An assessor evaluates one sample (five cups) and assigns:

| Attribute | Cupper's Score |
|-----------|---------------|
| Fragrance/Aroma | 8.50 |
| Flavor | 8.75 |
| Aftertaste | 8.25 |
| Acidity | 8.00 |
| Body | 7.75 |
| Balance | 8.00 |
| Sweetness | 7.50 |
| Clean Cup | 10.00 |
| Uniformity | 10.00 |
| Overall | 8.25 |

No taints; one cup judged "moldy" (fault) in cup #3.

**Calculation:**
- Sum of attributes = 8.50 + 8.75 + 8.25 + 8.00 + 7.75 + 8.00 + 7.50 + 10.00 + 10.00 + 8.25 = **83.00**
- Fault penalty = 1 cup × 4 = **4**
- **Final Score = 83.00 – 4 = 79.00**

## Quality Score Interpretations

| Score Range | Quality Level |
|-------------|---------------|
| 90+ | Outstanding |
| 85-89 | Excellent |
| 80-84 | Very Good |
| 70-79 | Good |
| 60-69 | Fair |
| Below 60 | Poor |

## Protocol Notes

- This scoring system is based on the **2004 SCA Cupping Protocol**
- Each cup should be evaluated individually for defects
- Scores should be recorded in increments of 0.25 or 0.50 points
- The protocol emphasizes consistency across multiple cups of the same sample
- Professional cuppers typically evaluate 5 cups per sample to assess uniformity

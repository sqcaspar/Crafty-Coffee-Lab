---

## Design-to-Code Workflow

### Step 1: Design in Figma
1. **Create new design file** in your Coffee Tracker project
2. **Set up artboards** with standard screen sizes:
   - Desktop: 1440px width
   - Tablet: 768px width  
   - Mobile: 375px width
3. **Use our color palette** (copy hex codes from above)
4. **Follow spacing grid** (8px increments)

### Step 2: Design Review & Export
1. **Complete your design** with all states (normal, hover, focus, disabled)
2. **Create interactive prototype** (optional but helpful)
3. **Export screenshots**:
   - PNG format, 2x resolution
   - Export individual screens and key components
   - Name files clearly: `home-page-desktop.png`, `recipe-card-hover.png`

### Step 3: Capture & Share with Claude Code

#### What to Capture from Figma:

**1. Visual Screenshots:**
- Right-click your design ‚Üí "Export" ‚Üí PNG format
- Set to 2x resolution for crisp images
- Export both overview and detail shots

**2. Technical Specifications (Inspect Panel):**
- Select any element ‚Üí Right panel ‚Üí "Inspect" tab
- **Copy these values exactly:**
  - `Fill: #ffffff` (background colors)
  - `Stroke: 1px solid #e5e5e5` (borders)
  - `Corner radius: 16px` (rounded corners)
  - `Drop shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0,0,0,0.1)` (shadows)
  - `Width: 320px, Height: 240px` (dimensions)
  - `Padding: 24px` (inner spacing)
  - `Gap: 16px` (space between elements)

**3. Typography Details:**
- Select text ‚Üí Inspect panel shows:
  - `Inter, 16px, Medium` (font family, size, weight)
  - `Line height: 24px` (spacing between lines)
  - `Letter spacing: -0.5px` (character spacing)
  - `Fill: #262626` (text color)

**4. Layout Measurements:**
- Use Figma's measurement tool (hold Alt/Option while hovering)
- Capture spacing between elements
- Note alignment relationships (centered, left-aligned, etc.)

#### How to Pass Information to Claude Code:

**Method 1: Screenshot + Specifications**
```
1. Upload/attach your PNG exports
2. Copy-paste specifications from inspect panel
3. Add written descriptions for interactions
```

**Method 2: Detailed Text Description**
```

## Design Best Practices

### Component-Based Thinking
**Think in React Components:**
- **Atomic elements**: Buttons, inputs, icons
- **Molecules**: Search bar, card header, form fields
- **Organisms**: Navigation, recipe card, form sections
- **Templates**: Page layouts with content areas

**Example Component Breakdown:**
```
Recipe Card Component:
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Card Container (background, border, shadow)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Recipe Image (aspect ratio 16:9)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Card Header
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Recipe Title (text)
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Rating Stars (5 icons)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Favorite Button (icon + state)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Card Body
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Recipe Details (origin, method, date)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Tasting Notes (truncated text)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Card Actions
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Edit Button
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Delete Button
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ More Options Menu
```

### Responsive Design Guidelines
**Mobile-First Approach:**
1. **Start with mobile design** (375px width)
2. **Scale up to tablet** (768px width)
3. **Optimize for desktop** (1440px+ width)

**Key Breakpoints:**
- Mobile: 375px - 767px
- Tablet: 768px - 1023px
- Desktop: 1024px+

**Responsive Considerations:**
- **Navigation**: Hamburger menu on mobile, tabs on desktop
- **Grid layouts**: 1 column mobile ‚Üí 2-3 columns tablet ‚Üí 4+ columns desktop
- **Forms**: Single column on mobile, multi-column on desktop
- **Typography**: Smaller sizes on mobile

### Interactive States Design
**Always design these states:**
- **Default**: Normal appearance
- **Hover**: Subtle highlight (desktop only)
- **Focus**: Clear focus indicator for accessibility
- **Active/Pressed**: Visual feedback during interaction
- **Disabled**: Reduced opacity/greyed out
- **Loading**: Skeleton loaders or spinners
- **Error**: Red indicators for validation errors
- **Success**: Green confirmations

### Data Scenarios
**Design for real data:**
- **Empty states**: "No recipes yet" with call-to-action
- **Loading states**: Skeleton components while data loads
- **Error states**: Connection issues, server errors
- **Long content**: Recipe names that wrap, long descriptions
- **Many items**: How grids look with 20+ recipes
- **Single item**: How lists look with only 1 recipe

## Technical Considerations

### What Translates Well
‚úÖ **Easy to implement:**
- Solid colors and gradients
- Standard border radius
- Box shadows
- Typography hierarchy
- Grid layouts
- Flexbox layouts
- Simple animations (fade, slide, scale)
- CSS transforms

### What's Challenging
‚ö†Ô∏è **Requires careful planning:**
- Complex animations with multiple steps
- Custom illustrations (need SVG export)
- Non-standard fonts (licensing issues)
- Overlapping elements with precise positioning
- Complex masking effects
- Custom scrollbars

‚ùå **Avoid or simplify:**
- Figma-specific effects (noise, inner shadow combinations)
- Complex image filters
- Video backgrounds
- Advanced prototyping interactions
- Non-web fonts

### Performance Considerations
**Image Optimization:**
- **Icons**: Use SVG, not PNG
- **Photos**: Optimize file size, consider WebP format
- **Illustrations**: SVG preferred over complex PNG

**Animation Performance:**
- **Prefer**: transform, opacity changes
- **Avoid**: animating width, height, top, left properties
- **Use**: GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity)

### Accessibility Requirements
**Color Contrast:**
- **Text on background**: Minimum 4.5:1 contrast ratio
- **Interactive elements**: Clear visual distinction
- **Error states**: Don't rely on color alone

**Focus Indicators:**
- **Visible focus rings** on all interactive elements
- **Logical tab order** through the interface
- **Skip links** for keyboard navigation

**Touch Targets:**
- **Minimum size**: 44px √ó 44px for mobile
- **Adequate spacing** between clickable elements

## Collaboration Process

### Communication Protocol
**When sharing designs:**
1. **Context**: Explain what you're designing and why
2. **Requirements**: List specific functionality needed
3. **Priority**: Mark which parts are most important
4. **Timeline**: When you need it implemented

**Example communication:**
```
Hi! I've designed a new recipe card layout. 

Context: The current cards feel too cramped, so I made them larger with better spacing.

Requirements:
- Must show recipe image, title, rating, and date
- Favorite button should toggle state
- Hover effect for desktop users
- Responsive for mobile (stack elements vertically)

Priority: High - this affects the main recipe list view

Files attached: recipe-card-desktop.png, recipe-card-mobile.png, recipe-card-hover.png

Let me know if you need any clarifications!
```

### Review Process
**After I implement your design:**
1. **Test on localhost:3000** in different browsers
2. **Check mobile responsiveness** (resize browser window)
3. **Test interactions** (hover, click, form inputs)
4. **Compare with your Figma design**
5. **Document any differences** or requested changes

**Feedback Format:**
```
Overall: Looks great! Few adjustments needed:

‚úÖ Correct:
- Colors match perfectly
- Spacing looks right
- Hover effects work well

üîÑ Adjustments needed:
- Recipe title font should be slightly larger (18px instead of 16px)
- Card shadow too strong - can we reduce opacity to 0.1?
- Mobile: buttons stack weirdly, can they be side by side?

‚ùì Questions:
- Should the favorite star be filled when selected?
- What happens when recipe title is very long?
```

### Iterative Refinement
**Typical iteration cycle:**
1. **Initial implementation** (80% match to design)
2. **Your feedback** on differences
3. **Refinement** (95% match)
4. **Final polish** (pixel-perfect)
5. **Cross-browser testing**
6. **Mobile optimization**

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Issue: "Colors don't match exactly"**
- Solution: Use Figma's inspect panel to copy exact hex codes
- Share color values: `#f5f5f5` not "light gray"

**Issue: "Layout breaks on mobile"**
- Solution: Design mobile version explicitly, don't assume auto-scaling works

**Issue: "Animation feels different than expected"**
- Solution: Describe timing and easing in detail
- Reference: "Should feel like iOS button press" or "Smooth like Gmail"

**Issue: "Component looks different in browser"**
- Solution: Fonts render differently - minor adjustments are normal
- Focus on proportions and spacing rather than pixel-perfect matching

**Issue: "Interactive prototype doesn't work in code"**
- Solution: Figma prototypes are guidelines, not exact specifications
- Describe the intended interaction in words

### Getting Help
**When stuck on design decisions:**
- Look at modern web apps: Linear, Notion, Stripe Dashboard
- Check design systems: Material Design, Apple HIG, Ant Design
- Use Figma Community templates for inspiration

**When technical limitations arise:**
- I'll suggest alternative approaches that achieve the same user experience
- We can iterate on solutions together
- Performance and accessibility always take priority

## Design Maintenance & Updates

### Keeping Your Figma Designs Updated

**1. Version Control in Figma:**
- **Page versions**: Figma automatically saves version history
- **Manual versions**: Click "+" next to file name ‚Üí "Save to version history"
- **Naming convention**: "v1.0 - Initial Design", "v1.1 - Card Updates", etc.
- **Access history**: File menu ‚Üí "Show version history"

**2. Design System Evolution:**
- **Keep components updated**: When I implement changes, update your Figma components
- **Sync colors**: If we adjust colors in code, update your Figma color styles
- **Typography updates**: Match any font size/weight changes made during implementation

**3. Documentation Workflow:**
```
After each implementation cycle:
1. Update Figma designs based on final coded version
2. Screenshot the actual implemented UI
3. Compare with original design and note differences
4. Update Figma to match successful implementations
5. Document any design decisions that changed during coding
```

### Future Design Updates

**When you want to make changes:**

**Small Updates (colors, spacing, text):**
1. Make changes in Figma
2. Export affected components
3. Share: "Quick update - changed card shadow from 0.1 to 0.05 opacity"
4. I update code accordingly

**Medium Updates (layout changes, new components):**
1. Design new version in Figma
2. Create comparison screenshots (before/after)
3. Export new components with specifications
4. Share complete component breakdown
5. I implement with full testing

**Major Updates (complete redesigns):**
1. Create new Figma page for redesign
2. Keep old version for reference
3. Design complete user flows
4. Export comprehensive specifications
5. Plan implementation in phases with you

### Long-term Figma Organization

**File Structure Evolution:**
```
üìÅ Coffee Recipe Tracker UI
  üìÑ üéØ Current Version (working designs)
  üìÑ üì¶ Implemented Components (matches live code)
  üìÑ üî¨ Experiments (trying new ideas)
  üìÑ üìö Archive (old versions)
  üìÑ üìã Design System (colors, typography, components)
```

**Component Library Management:**
- **Create Figma components** for reusable elements (buttons, cards, forms)
- **Publish component library** for consistency across designs
- **Update components** when code implementation teaches us better patterns
- **Document usage rules** for each component

### Staying Synchronized

**Monthly Review Process:**
1. **Compare live app** (localhost:3000) with Figma designs
2. **Note any differences** that crept in during development
3. **Update Figma** to match the live version
4. **Plan upcoming improvements** based on usage patterns

**When Implementation Differs from Design:**
```
Sometimes code implementation reveals better solutions:

Original Figma design: Button with 12px padding
Implementation reality: Needs 16px for better touch targets
Resolution: Update Figma to 16px, document the reason

This creates a feedback loop that improves both design and code!
```

**Design Evolution Examples:**
- **Responsive discoveries**: Mobile testing might reveal better layouts
- **Accessibility improvements**: Implementation adds focus states not in original design
- **Performance optimizations**: Simpler animations that work better in browser
- **User feedback**: Real usage data suggests different information hierarchy

### Best Practices for Design Longevity

**1. Design with Code Reality in Mind:**
- Test your designs on actual devices
- Consider loading states from the beginning
- Design for edge cases (long text, missing images)
- Think about keyboard navigation

**2. Maintain Design Documentation:**
- **Decision log**: Why you chose certain layouts or colors
- **Component specs**: Detailed breakdown of each UI component
- **User flow maps**: How different screens connect
- **Responsive rules**: How layouts adapt across screen sizes

**3. Regular Design Health Checks:**
- **Monthly**: Compare Figma vs. live app
- **Quarterly**: Review design system for consistency
- **After major features**: Update component library
- **Before new designs**: Ensure using latest established patterns

This process ensures your designs stay relevant and implementable over time!
